        <h3>Relection on Final</h3>
        <p>When I didn't have the motivation to cram like I should have to make sure the final was turned on time. Is when I knew I lost all the passion I thought I had for this. I realized this wasn't the major for me. Which is fine I just wish I would've realized this sooner. This was a trial and error for me. Interest change like mine did, I hate that I wasted time with lesrning something I didn't want to.</p>
